Routing is the process of transmitting data packets from one computer to another, allowing messages to reach their intended destination. A router is a network device that routes data packets between computer networks. It connects to two or more data lines from various networks (as opposed to a network switch, which links data lines from the same network). This project focuses on the top-level architecture of routers and how sub-modules such as Register, FIFO, FSM, and Synchronizer are synthesized, simulated, and connected to the top module.
